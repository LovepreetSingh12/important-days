            <p>Every year on 15th January we commemorate the day as Army Day across the country. This day is commemorated as the ‘Army
            Day’ because on 15th January 1949, General (then Field Marshal) Kodandera Madappa Cariappa took over as the charge of
            Commander-in-chief from the last British Commander-in-chief General Sir. Francis Butcher. And to commemorate this day, we
            celebrate it as the ‘Army Day’ and on this particular day we pay homage to all the martyrs of the country who laid down
            in glory and sacrificed their lives for the pride of the country. The motto of Indian Army is “Service before self”</p>
